# OpusPortal
### Andree Uuetoa

This project started out as a home project for one of the major courses in my curriculum at TalTech.
Later I decided to make the source code public and continue working on it.

The plan with this project is to create a timetable and concert management system for teachers and students at MUBA - Tallinn School of Music and Ballet.
This git repository contains the source code for the backend of the application.
The code for the frontend can be found here: https://github.com/andreeuuetoa/opusportal-front-react
